            Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American transgender activist, played
            a pivotal role in the Stonewall uprising of 1969, a turning point in
            the LGBTQ+ rights movement. Co-founding the Street Transvestite
            Action Revolutionaries (STAR), Johnson tirelessly fought for the
            rights of transgender and homeless communities. Her legacy as a
            trailblazer, advocate, and symbol of resilience continues to inspire
            and uplift marginalized voices within the LGBTQ+ community.
