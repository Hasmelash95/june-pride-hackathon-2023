          Stonewall Riots (1969): The Stonewall Riots were a series of
          spontaneous protests by members of the LGBTQ+ community in response
          to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in New York
          City. The riots marked a turning point in the LGBTQ+ rights

          The Decriminalization of Homosexuality (1967 onwards): The
          decriminalization of homosexuality in various countries around the
          world has been a crucial milestone in LGBTQ+ history. In 1967, the
          Sexual Offences Act was passed in the United Kingdom, partially
          decriminalizing homosexuality. This event paved the way for
          subsequent legal reforms and social acceptance in many countries,
          leading to greater LGBTQ+ rights.

          The AIDS Crisis (1980s-1990s): The emergence of the AIDS epidemic in
          the 1980s had a profound impact on the LGBTQ+ community. This health
          crisis brought attention to the discrimination and marginalization
          faced by the community and led to significant activism. LGBTQ+
          individuals and their allies came together to raise awareness about
          the disease, advocate for better healthcare and support systems, and
          fight against stigmatization

          Marriage Equality Movement (2000s onwards): The fight for marriage
          equality has been a landmark struggle for LGBTQ+ rights. Beginning
          in the 2000s, numerous countries and states started legalizing
          same-sex marriage. The legalization of marriage equality has been a
          crucial step towards recognizing and protecting the rights of LGBTQ+
          individuals and their relationships, promoting societal acceptance
          and equality.
