## **Project Goals**

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon June 2023 Theme of "Pride", create an application which follows the theme of LGBTQ+ Pride. The application should be meaningful and educative, and bring purpose and connection to the user.

## **User Experience**

Connect+ prioritises delivering a seamless and delightful user experience to ensure that our application is accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable for everyone in the LGBTQ+ community.

* **LGBTQ+ Podcast**: The application features a testimonials page where users can engage in stories and experiences as told by other people of the same community. The user is able to emotionally connect and recognise their experiences in these testimonials.

* **Milestones**: It also features an educational page where users can be exposed to current/historical figures that have had a monumental impact in the community or in history. Featured also are historical events. 

* **Conversation**: The application features a game which has been designed to produce random questions for the user. This game is to intuitively be used in person with another person, as a way of getting to know them at a deeper, human level. 

## **Target Audience**

Our target audience is everybody that is a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and even those who are allies, thus being able to educate themselves and learn about LGBTQ+ community by having exposure to the history and struggles in this domain.

## **Deployment, Development & Version Control**

The development environment used for this project was GitPod.

Each software developer on the team created their own individual branch divergent from main from the get-go and have communicated via Slack to collaborate, pitch ideas, fix bugs and talk about relevant Pull Requests. Regular commits and pushes to Github have been employed to be able to track and trace the development process of the web application.

For local deployments instructions shall be written below, along with instructions with deployment to GitHub Pages, the hosting service used to deploy this particular website.
