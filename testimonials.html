        Elijah, in their 40s, shares their journey of discovering their
        non-binary, trans-masculine identity while navigating their Jewish faith.
        Despite initial concerns about the compatibility of being trans and
        Jewish, Elijah found a supportive community that allowed them to embrace
        both aspects of their identity. They highlight the significance of a
        transformative visit to the Western Wall and the challenges faced from
        negative online reactions. Elijah emphasizes the importance of personal
        faith and hopes for a broader understanding of the multi-faceted nature of
        being transgender.
